#summary How to get started with Spring, Ehcache, and this project

= Preface =

This project is the spiritual successor to the support for Ehcache in the [https://springmodules.dev.java.net/ Spring Modules] project. When the authors of this project found out that Spring Modules was deprecated and no support for Spring 3 was planned, we decided it was time to create this project.

The authors of this project both have extensive experience with Spring and Ehcache, so much of our documentation assumes you are already familiar with both.
