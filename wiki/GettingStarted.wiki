#summary How to get started with Spring, Ehcache, and this project

= Preface =

This project is the spiritual successor to the support for Ehcache in the [https://springmodules.dev.java.net/ Spring Modules] project. When the authors of this project found out that Spring Modules was deprecated and no support for Spring 3 was planned, we decided it was time to create this project.

The authors of this project both have extensive experience with Spring and Ehcache, so much of our documentation assumes you are already familiar with both.

= Intended Usage =

The following steps are merely a suggestion, you don't have to follow them to the letter.

  # Create a new [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] project.
  # Add this project as a dependency (see the Project Home page for the recommended version). This will in turn add Spring 3 and Ehcache 2 to your project's dependencies.
  # Write your Spring Application, including [UsingCacheAnnotations] and/or [UsingTriggersRemove].
  # Add the required configuration for this project to your Spring configuration (see [UsingCacheAnnotations]).
  # Create the Ehcache configuration and place it within the project classpath - http://ehcache.org/documentation/configuration.html
